# Map
- It allows us to store data in a key-value pair and remembers the original insertion order of the keys similar to other programming languages. 
- In TypeScript map, we can use any value either as a key or as a value.
- We can iterate over map keys or values or entries by using 'for...of' loop.
# Set
- It allows us to store distinct data (each value occur only once) into the List similar to other programming languages. 
- Sets are a bit similar to maps, but it stores only keys, not the key-value pairs.
- TypeScript set method also allows the chaining of add() method. 
- We can iterate over set values or entries by using 'for...of' loop. The following example helps to understand it more clearly.

# Date
- The Date object represents a date and time functionality in TypeScript. 
- It allows us to get or set the year, month and day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond.
- If we create a date without any argument passed to its constructor, by default, it contains the date and time of the user's computer.
- The Date object also provides the functions which deal with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The World Time Standard is based on UTC time.
