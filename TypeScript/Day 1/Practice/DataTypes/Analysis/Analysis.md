1. Learning baisc data types in typescript.
2. JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives: string, number, and boolean. Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.
3. string represents string values like "Hello, world"
number is for numbers like 42. 
4. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so thereâ€™s no equivalent to int or float - everything is simply number.
5. boolean is for the two values true and false.
6. All numbers are store as floating point number.
- These number can be octal , decimal or hexadecimal.
7. String type will work with textual data.
- We include string literals in our scripts by enclosing them in single or double quotation marks.
- it also represents a sequence of unicode characters.
- It embedded the expression in the form of ${expr}.
8. Any is the "Super type" of all data type in Typescript.
- It is use to represent any javascript value.
- It allows us to opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation.
- Any type is useful when we do not know about the type of value and we want to skip the type-checking  on compile time.
