# Union
- Typescript can combine one or two different types of data in a single type,which is called a union type.
- union types are a powerful way to express a variable with multiple types.
- Two or more data types can be combined by using the pipe ('|') Symbol between he types.

# Enums
- Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. 
- TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

# Interface
- An interface is a structure which acts as a contract in application.
- It defines the syntax for classes to follow , means a classs which implements an interface  is bound to implement all its members.
- It cannot be instantiated but can be referenced by the class which implements it.
- The Typescript compiler uses interface for type-checking that is also known as "duck typing" or "structual subtyping".
- Interface in Typescript can be used to define a type and also to implement it in the class.
- Typescript interface is also used to define a type of a function.This ensures the function signature.
-Interface can extend one or more interfaces.This makes writing interfaces flexible and reusable.

# class
- Classes are used to create reusable components and acts as a template for creatind objects.
- It is a logical entity which store variables and functions to perform opereations.
- It is different from the interface which has an imolementation inside it,whereas an interface does not have any implementation inside it.

# function
- A function is the logical blocks of code to organize the program.
- Typesript can also be used to create functions either as a named function or as an anonymous function.
- function ensure that our program is readable,maintainable and reusable.
- A function declaraion has a function's name,return type and parameters.
